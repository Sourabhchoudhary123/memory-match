Project Setup
To set up and run the game locally, you only need to ensure the following three files are in the same directory:

1) index.html: The main HTML structure.

2) style.css: The CSS for layout, styling, and the 3D card flip animation.

3) script.js: The JavaScript logic for game state, card shuffling, flipping, and match checking.

How to Run:
Open the index.html file directly in any modern web browser.

How to Play
The objective of the game is to find all the matching pairs of cards in the fewest moves possible.

Start: The game board will display 16 cards face-down (eight unique pairs).

Flip: Click on any card to flip it over and reveal the fruit emoji on its front face.

Second Card: Click a second card to flip it over.

Match Check:

Match: If the two cards have the same fruit emoji, they are a match. They will stay face-up, and you proceed to the next pair.

Mismatch: If the two cards are different, the board locks for 1 second, and they will automatically flip back face-down.

Winning: The game ends when all eight pairs have been matched, and an alert will congratulate you.

Restart: Click the "Restart Game" button to shuffle the cards and start a brand new game.
